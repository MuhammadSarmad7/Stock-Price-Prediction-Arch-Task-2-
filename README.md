# Stock Price Prediction
**Objective:** Build a model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

**My Implementation:**

* **Model:** Used Linear Regression to predict the "Close" price.
* **Results:** Achieved an **R² score of 0.99** and an **MSE of 4.299**.
* **Additional:** Created a comparison DataFrame to track the difference between Actual and Predicted prices.
